## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end market data pipeline: a low-latency binary protocol decoder written in C++, a streaming/concurrency layer, a pre-trade risk engine, a market-making strategy module, and a TimescaleDB + Grafana analytics layer running against **695+ million real Binance BTCUSDT trades** spanning January–June 2025.

The emphasis throughout is on the systems-engineering problems behind electronic trading infrastructure, not on producing a profitable strategy:

- Zero-copy, cache-friendly binary protocol decoding
- Lock-free / concurrent streaming pipelines
- High-throughput time-series ingestion and storage
- Pre-trade risk rule enforcement
- Real-time observability and monitoring

## Components

### Decoder (`src/`, `bench/`, `include/`)
Binary protocol decoder with naive and memory-mapped implementations, benchmarked head-to-head.

### Streaming Layer (`streaming/`)
Ring buffer and mutex-queue message passing, with adaptive batching. Benchmarked separately for single-core decode latency vs. multi-core concurrent throughput (`bench_concurrency`, `bench_adaptive`).

### Risk Engine (`risk/`)
Configurable, independent pre-trade rules — price collar, order size limits, inventory limits, kill switch — designed so new rules can be added without touching the core engine.

### Strategy Layer (`strategy/`)
Avellaneda–Stoikov market-making model with a backtesting harness (`backtest.py`, `backtest_as.py`), run against real historical price data.

### Analytics (`analytics/`)
Latency, market regime, TCA, throughput, and summary statistics modules.

### Python Bindings (`python/`)
Pybind11 bindings exposing the C++ decoder to Python for research workflows.

### Data Pipeline & Dashboard (`tools/`, `grafana-stack/`)
- `convert_binance_csv.py` — converts raw Binance CSV exports into the internal 33-byte binary wire format
- `load_trades.py` — streams the binary files into a TimescaleDB hypertable via bulk `COPY`
- `setup_ohlcv_aggregates.sql` — builds 1-hour/1-day OHLCV continuous aggregates so dashboard queries never scan raw tick data
- `validate_data.py` — verifies date coverage, missing days, and row-level sanity checks
- `grafana-stack/` — Docker Compose stack (TimescaleDB + Grafana) with the full executive dashboard

## Results

### Decoder performance
| Decoder | Latency | Throughput |
|---|---|---|
| Naive | 26.48 ns/message | 37.8M msg/s |
| Memory-mapped | 7.75 ns/message | 129.1M msg/s |

*(re-verify with `make bench` before publishing final numbers — see Reproducing below)*

### Data pipeline
- **695,541,427** real Binance BTCUSDT trades loaded, Jan 1 – Jun 30 2025
- Raw binary size **23 GB** → compressed TimescaleDB hypertable **15 GB** (1.5x, native columnstore compression)
- **181 / 181 expected days present — 0 missing days**, verified via automated integrity check (`tools/validate_data.py`)
- **0 rows** with zero/negative price or quantity across all 695M+ records
- 27 compressed chunks, queried through 1h/1d continuous aggregates (~4,500 rows total) so dashboard panels never touch the raw 695M-row table directly

**Monthly trade volume:**

| Month | Trades |
|---|---:|
| Jan 2025 | 135,946,515 |
| Feb 2025 | 128,881,324 |
| Mar 2025 | 136,245,963 |
| Apr 2025 | 104,290,701 |
| May 2025 | 108,937,329 |
| Jun 2025 | 81,239,595 |
| **Total** | **695,541,427** |

### Risk & performance analytics (BTC market benchmark, computed from real price data)
- Sharpe ratio (annualized): `[CONFIRM]`
- Historical VaR (95% / 99%, 1-day): `[CONFIRM]`
- Max drawdown: `[CONFIRM]`
- Decoder benchmark p50 / p95 / p99 latency by decoder type: `[CONFIRM]`

*(pull these from the dashboard's Risk & Performance row after the final run and paste them in here as concrete, quotable numbers)*

## Reproducing This Project

**1. Build and test the C++ layer:**
```bash
make clean && make
make test              # runs test_decoder, test_ring_buffer
make bench             # generates 2M synthetic messages, benchmarks decoders
make bench-streaming   # concurrency + adaptive batching benchmarks
```

**2. Bring up the data stack:**
```bash
cd grafana-stack && docker compose up -d
```

**3. Load real market data** (requires Binance historical CSVs converted to the internal binary format via `tools/convert_binance_csv.py`):
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary pandas numpy --break-system-packages
python3 tools/load_trades.py --truncate
```

**4. Build the OHLCV aggregates powering the dashboard:**
```bash
docker exec -i quant-timescaledb psql -U quant -d quant < tools/setup_ohlcv_aggregates.sql
```

**5. Validate data integrity:**
```bash
python3 tools/validate_data.py
```

**6. Import the dashboard:** Grafana → Dashboards → New → Import → upload `grafana-stack/dashboards/executive-overview.json`

## Future Work

- SIMD-optimized parsing
- Lock-free processing pipeline
- Live exchange connectivity (currently historical-only)
- Multi-symbol support and order book reconstruction
- Full strategy backtesting engine wired into the risk/dashboard layer (currently, market-data metrics and strategy backtests are separate — see note below)
- Latency regression tracking across decoder versions

---

## Scope Notes

Some metrics that would require live strategy execution (equity curve, win rate, expectancy, slippage/TCA on real fills) are intentionally kept separate from the market-data dashboard — the `trades` table holds raw market ticks, not strategy positions. The `strategy/` module's backtest results are a separate artifact from the live dashboard and are not conflated with buy-and-hold market benchmarks shown there.

Decoder latency figures are measured from real, timed runs of the C++ decoder; the input stream used for that specific benchmark is synthetic (standard practice for latency/throughput testing, not requiring a live feed).
